        <Prose>
          Game offers are among the highest-paying tasks on Freecoino. Advertisers pay you to install
          their game and reach specific milestones — like completing the tutorial, reaching Level 10,
          or playing for a set number of days. The more challenging the milestone, the higher the payout.
