        <SectionHeading>How Paid Surveys Work on Freecoino</SectionHeading>
        <Prose>
          Market research companies need real opinions from real people. They pay platforms like Freecoino to connect them with survey respondents. When you qualify for and complete a survey, the research company pays us and we credit coins to your account. Surveys typically take 5–20 minutes and pay between 20–200 coins depending on length and topic.
