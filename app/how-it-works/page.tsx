          Most offers credit within 5 minutes to 24 hours depending on the type. Surveys and app installs
          are fastest. Game milestone offers may take 24–48 hours after you reach the required level.
          Withdrawals are processed as LTC to your wallet — most complete within minutes after you submit
          a cashout request.
