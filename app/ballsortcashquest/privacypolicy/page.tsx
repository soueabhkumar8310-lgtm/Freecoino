        <Section title="1. Information We Collect">
          BallSortCashQuest collects minimal data to provide and improve the game:
          game progress (coins, highest level reached, ad statistics) stored locally
          and synced to the cloud using an anonymous account; your device&apos;s country
          code detected from SIM/network settings for withdrawal processing; and your
          Litecoin address submitted only when you request a withdrawal.
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. How We Use Your Information">
          We use your data to: save and restore your game progress across devices;
          process withdrawal requests for earned rewards; serve and measure
          advertisements; and improve the game and fix technical issues.
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Third-Party Services">
          The game integrates with third-party services, each with their own privacy
          policies: <strong>Firebase</strong> (Google) for cloud storage, anonymous
          authentication, analytics, and crash reporting; <strong>IronSource
          LevelPlay</strong> for ad mediation (banner, interstitial, and rewarded
          ads); and <strong>CPX Research</strong> for optional surveys you can
          choose to complete for in-app rewards. We recommend reviewing the privacy
          policies of these services.
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Advertising">
          The game may display advertisements served by third-party ad networks. These
          networks may use device identifiers, IP addresses, and interaction data to
          serve personalized or non-personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized
          advertising in your device settings.
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. Data Security">
          We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data. Game
          progress is stored securely in Firebase Firestore. No passwords, financial
          information, or sensitive personal data are collected by the game directly.
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Children&apos;s Privacy">
