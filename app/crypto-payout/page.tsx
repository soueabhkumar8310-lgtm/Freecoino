          earnings as Litecoin (LTC) directly to your crypto wallet. This means faster payouts,
          lower fees, and full control over your money.

        <SectionHeading>Setting Up Your LTC Wallet</SectionHeading>
        <Prose>
          You need a Litecoin wallet address to receive withdrawals. Popular options include Exodus,
          Trust Wallet, and exchange wallets from Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. Create your wallet
          first, then copy your LTC receiving address to the Freecoino Cashout page. Always
          double-check your address — crypto transactions cannot be reversed.
