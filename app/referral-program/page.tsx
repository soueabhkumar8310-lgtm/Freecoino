        <SectionHeading>Referral Earnings Example</SectionHeading>
        <Prose>
          If you refer 10 friends who each earn $20/month, you&apos;d earn $10/month in referral
          commissions (5% × $200 total). Refer 50 active users earning $30/month each, and your
          passive referral income becomes $75/month — on top of your own earnings.
