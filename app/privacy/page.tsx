        <Section title="1. Information We Collect">
          When you create an account, we collect your email address and authentication
          credentials. During your use of the Platform, we also collect: your IP address,
          browser type and device information, offer completion data (which offers you
          complete, coins earned, timestamps), withdrawal history, and referral activity.
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. How We Use Your Information">
          We use your information to: operate and maintain your account; credit coins for
          completed offers; process withdrawal requests; detect and prevent fraud, abuse,
          and multiple accounts; improve the Platform experience; send important account
          notifications (such as withdrawal confirmations or policy changes); and comply
          with legal obligations.
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Third-Party Offerwalls & Partners">
          When you complete offers, you interact with third-party offerwall providers (such
          as CPX Research, Lootably, BitLabs, AdGate Media, and others). These providers may
          collect additional data about you according to their own privacy policies. We share
          your user ID with these providers so they can attribute offer completions to your
          account. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any offerwall you interact
          with.

          security of your data.
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Data Retention">
          We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you request

          transaction records may be retained indefinitely for accounting purposes.
